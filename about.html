      			<p><em>Justin B. Gornell</em> &nbsp;graduated from the College of the Holy Cross in 1997 with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and a concentration in Biological-Psychology. He graduated from New York University in 2001 as a Doctor of Physical Therapy. Dr. Gornell became board certified in orthopedics &lpar;OCS - orthopedic clinical specialist&rpar; in 2005.</p> <br>
      			<p itemprop="description">Justin had been working with orthopedic and sports-related injuries in a typical out-patient physical therapy clinic for many years.  That environment requires the therapist to treat multiple patients per hour and therefore never giving undivided attention for more than15 to 20 minutes.  Justin believed the patients deserved better care.  In 2009, he founded Paradigm Physical Therapy, to provide optimum care and treatment.  Since there is no auxiliary staff at Paradigm, the patient is with the physical therapist during the entire session.  </p> <br>
            <p itemprop="description">Dr. Gornell assists New York University's Physical Therapy program as a master clinician, teaching and educating students about orthopedic physical therapy conditions.   He is an active member of the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) and of their Orthopedic Section, constantly keeping up with current research.</p> <br>
      			<p>Justin enjoys running, working out, skiing, as well as spending time with his family.  He coaches and is very active with his four young boys.</p>

          <p>Two injuries in two years! More than anybody wants to deal with but it happened to me. It was immediately apparent that Justin, who came highly recommended, was extremely professional.  But more than that, I could tell from the start that he was highly competent, warm and genuinely concerned about my recovery. Justin is friendly, funny and makes the effort much easier to handle. I wouldn't hesitate for an instant to recommend him to my closest family and friends.</p>

          <blockquote>
          <p>I will always remember the clear, crisp winter day in February 2006, when a pristine white snow blanketed Central Park; when I slipped on a slick of ice, fell backwards and broke my arm. The orthopedic surgeon told me I would need physical therapy and the next thing I knew I was being interviewed by Justin. His manner immediately put me at ease, and through a combination of treatment and vigorous exercise, I gradually recovered. Without Justin's expertise, dedication and encouragement, I doubt if I would have regained the use of my arm. Since being treated for the fractured radius, stress-related muscle problems have brought me back to Justin for treatment. Unlike many medical specialists who frequently perceive patients solely as their injuries, Justin sees and engages the whole person. By actively listening and asking questions, he is able to assess and evaluate their condition, thereby formulating a comprehensive course of individualized treatment.</p>
          <p>Justin is down-to-earth and without pretense. His vivacious personality and wry sense of humor combine to constantly reassure his patients that they are in good hands.</p>
